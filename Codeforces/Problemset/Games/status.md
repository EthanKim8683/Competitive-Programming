959A|800|AC|1|Understand that if `n` is even, Mahmoud can subtract all of it, causing Ehab to lose. If `n` is odd, Mahmoud can subtract `n` to any positive odd number, allowing Ehab to then subtract all of it, causing Mahmoud to lose.
1480A|800|AC|1|Understand that Bob and Alice always want to choose the most significant (lowest) index possible and change it to the lexicographically largest or smallest character, respectively.
1719A|800|AC|1|Understand that an even number of cells invariably requires an odd number of odd-number turns to traverse and an odd number of cells requires an even number of odd-number turns to traverse. This means that the parity of the total number of turns is invariant, where Burenka wins with an odd number of total turns and Tonya otherwise.
1684A|800|AC|1|Understand that, unless `n` has two digits, the smallest integer Alice can get is the minimum digit in `n`, otherwise it's the second digit. This is because Alice must swap any two digits and, if the number of digits is three or greater, she can swap the minimum digit to the second position to prepare for `|n| = 2` and idly swap random other digits in the meantime.
1841A|800|AC|2|Understand that for all `n` greater than four, Alice will win. In Alice's first move, she can produce a board equal to `{n - 2, 1, 1}` (otherwise, she loses: `{1, 2}`, `{2}`). As long as it is impossible for `1 + 1` to equal `n - 2`, Bob can only make a move resulting in Alice winning.
