## Proposition
The equation[^1], is unsatisfiable for values of `n` for which `4 | n` holds false.

## Lemma #1
The equation is satisfied when there is an equal number of terms of either `1` or `-1`.

## Lemma #2
Every `a` contributes to 4 distinct terms.

## Lemma #3
A term's value is based on parity of the number of contributing `a`'s with value `-1`.

*Let `A` be the set of terms of one parity.*<br>
*Let `B` be the set of terms of another parity.*<br>

## Lemma #4
With lemmas #1 and #3, the equation is satisfied when:
```
|A| - |B| = 0
```

## Lemma #5
With lemma #3, initially (all `a` are `1`) the relationship between the cardinalities of `A` and `B` is as follows:
```
|A| - |B| = n
```

## Lemma #6
With lemma #3, the relationship between the cardinalities of `A` and `B` when any given `a` is assigned `-1` is as follows:

*Let `x` be the number of elements in `A` to which a given `a` contributes.*<br>
```
Δ|A| = -(x) + (4 - x) = 4 - 2x.
Δ|B| = +(x) - (4 - x) = 2x - 4.
Δ(|A| - |B|) = (4 - 2x) - (2x - 4) = 8 - 4x.
4 | Δ(|A| - |B|) ⇒ |A| - |B| (mod 4) is invariant
```

## Corollary
With lemmas #4, #5 and #6, if initially `|A| - |B| ≇ 0 (mod 4)`, or `4 ∤ n`, the equation is unsatisfiable.
