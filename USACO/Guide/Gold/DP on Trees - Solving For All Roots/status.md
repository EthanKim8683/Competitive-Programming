2010 - Patrol|Hard|AC|1|Understand that the distance decreased is equal to the size of the maximum cycle passing through the added edges. For $K = 2$, we can find two non-intersecting paths of maximum total length (joining them at the ends makes a cycle), for $K = 1$, we can find just one path of maximum length (joining its ends makes a cycle). This can be done using dynamic programming on trees, solving for all roots.
