2014 - The Stables of Genghis Khan|Normal|AC|1|Understand that each base case for an $x _ i$ handles all keys after $x _ {i - 1}$ and before $x _ {i + 1}$. Other than that, transitions for a range $[i, j]$ with root $l$ are as simple as adding the number of keys covered by the range, $x _ {j + 1} - x _ {i - 1}$, representing all keys passing through this range, as well as the cost of the ranges to the left and right of the root, representing the keys that are not immediately found in this range.
