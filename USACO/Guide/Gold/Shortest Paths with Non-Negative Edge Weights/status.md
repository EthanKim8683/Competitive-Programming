2021 - Robot|Hard|AC|3|Understand that a dynamic programming approach can be used to solve the problem, where each state is defined by the color of edge used to get there (or none at all). This is because, at each node, it is possible to change either one road's color, or the other same-color roads' color. And when doing the latter, the cost is decreased if the road used to get there was of the same color, and had been changed.
2011 - Find the Path|Hard|AC|3|Understand that a simple Dijkstra's on all critical points suffices. Critical points can be found using sweep line.
