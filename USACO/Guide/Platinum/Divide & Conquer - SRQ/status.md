Static Range Minimum Queries|Very Easy|AC|1|Understand that divide and conquer can be used to solve static range minimum queries.
2014 - Secret|Easy|AC|3|Understand that precomputing the left and right arrays for each middle, then solving for left and right for each query after finding the middle suffices.
Product on Segment|Easy|AC|1|Understand that precomputing the divide and conquer values and then answering each query in `O(log2(N))` time manages to pass just under the time limit.
2017 - Toll|Normal|AC|2|Understand that we can divide and conquer along the paths of each query, as each `i` such that `a / k <= i && i <= b / k` is guaranteed to be visited along the path from `a` to `b`.
