Sort Points by Argument|Easy|AC|1|Understand that, in order to sort on a cyclic (infinite) domain, a period must be established. To do this, the points can be split into halves (along the x-axis), where one half is greater than the other. Note that along the boundary between the two halves, the points could go either way. To solve this, we further divide said points into halves (this time along the y-axis). This results in a tide-pod-like division where cross products can then be used to compare points from within each half.
Segment Intersection|Easy|DNF|0|N/A
Segment Distance|Easy|AC|3|Understand that a "signed distance function" ([https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wlfyzl](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wlfyzl)) can be used to find the distance to a line from any given point.
